# Basic Login

First automation anywhere bot games challange.

---

## Review

A great place to start for anyone new to Automation Anywhere development. Many web applications
used by bots require some sort of login - in this challenge page, developers are asked to do
exactly that - just process a login.

Correctly fill in the username, password, and click submit for the scoring modal to appear.


Username: user@automationanywhere.com

Password: Automation123
