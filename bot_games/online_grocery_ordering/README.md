# Online Grocery Ordering

Heading to te second challange, it's a grocery list app that gives us a csv with data about foods
you have to order automatically. I decided to change the repository structure to store all needful
information on a shared folder for all challanges to reuse them.

## Solution Structure

- online_grocery_ordering/
  - data/
    - shopping-list.csv -> *Groceries to order*
  - media/ -> *Images for README*
  - main.py -> *Main file*
  - README.md -> *Documentation*

## Challange:

Learning to interact with both web objects and data sources is key to being a successful automation developer. In this challenge, you'll need to download the provided shopping list and add each item from the list to the shopping order before acknowledging the terms and submitting the order. Once the order has been submitted, the scoring modal will display your results.
